This is a group project by @vykupayu and @Metolkin focused on building a DeFi risk engine using Python.

This first version uses Bayesian regression combined with VaR and Sharpe ratio to assess stETH risk factors. 

The PoC has been built in the R programming language using the Bayes_Risk.ipynb notebook. 

The merged_data.csv has been extracted and preprocessed from Dune Analytics queries using the python_risk_import_v_0.1.py script.

The final report in the Czech language can be downloaded from Bayes_DeFi_Risk_v_0.1.pdf
